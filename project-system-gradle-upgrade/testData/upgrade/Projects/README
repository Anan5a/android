This is the folder for projects used in Upgrade Assistant integration tests.

Each project should have a state for each version of AGP we want to test this project upgrades with.
Each project state can be used for both 'upgrade from' and 'upgrade to' version.
Moreover there can be several states for the same AGP version, e.g. one using deprecated but still allowed APIs
and another using all the new APIs.

Please, use the following structure:
-Projects
  +-Project Name
    +-version1 - files
    |
    +-version2 - files

To avoid copying all unrelated files over for each version, copy only the files that supposed to change.
In project descriptor (AUATestProjectState) there is a 'projectBasePath' and 'projectChangesPath'.
The former should be the state with all project files present, the latter is the state with only
the changed files which are copied over the base state on load.
