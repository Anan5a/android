This directory contains unpacked contents of an AAR file produced by the following procedure:

1. In Studio create a project with an empty activity.
2. Enable namespacing
3. Add a library module, call it mylibrary
4. In the mylibrary module replace contents of AndroidManifest.xml with:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.mylibrary">
</manifest>
5. Create strings.xml under res/values with the following contents:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="my_aar_string">This string came from an AARv2</string>
</resources>
6. In the application directory run:
gw :mylibrary:assembleRelease
7. From mylibrary/build/outputs/aar/mylibrary-release.aar extract classes.jar and res.apk.
Put classes.jar in this directory and res.apk in res subdirectory. Please keep in mind that
this directory layout is temporary. It will be changed by moving res.apk to the same directory
as classes.jar. This change will happen when the AARv2 support is added to the model.
